 POLITICS_OLEH_LIASHKO_DESC: "Difficult times breed difficult men, and no man is more difficult - more radical - than Oleh Liashko. Though Liashko recognises the opportunity presented to him he bitterly curses the context in which he has received it - alas that he must now rule Chernihiv in such horrific times!\n\nFortunately, Liashko is not without help. The radical masses of Chernihiv became resentful, finding Zelenskyy too soft and weak-minded for their willing. Moreover, when the foreigners of the Speedwagon Foundation attempted to seize power in the oblast, Liashko heard the cries of the people - "how does a so-called Asian-American dare to rule us?" were the most printable sentiments expressed, organised a defense along the river, then held the line ever since. Though this required massive spending on defense, the people accepted it: for such was their fate.\n\nLiashko's goals are twofold. One short-term, one long-term. Drive out the Speedwagon Foundation, and any other anti-Ukraine forces; then construct a new, socially-oriented Ukrainian nation out of the ashes of the old: one under the leadership of the most people-centered - or is that popular or populist? - deputy of the old Verkhovna Rada. One under Liashko's rule of people."
