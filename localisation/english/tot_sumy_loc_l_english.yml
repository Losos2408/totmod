 POLITICS_SUMY_CHAOS_DESC: "When people look at Sumy Oblast, they see only void and chaos. Everyone is driven to madness, all orders have collapsed, and what remain are violence and vice. Streets are burnt into hell, kids are crying, schemers are laughing... Who would have known that, the center of everything would be a 17-year-old?\n\nGoyda, what is Goyda? Nyaruko was curious, so she brought Yasaka Mahiro and Hasuta to Ukraine - after which their fates was sealed, along with Kuuko's. She followed them to Ukraine as well secretly, but was found eventually.\n\nIs Goyda something like the color out of space? No, that's an understatement. It's not something the four could deal with easily. So, they§RCMNLCCCNMXTHAGHTNOHHHHHTOTHHH---§!\n\nAnd now, with their power out of control, the §RCrawling Chaos§!, or, §RNyarlathotep§!, awakes within Nyaruko. The chaos spread like a disease. All orders, of society, and of humanity, are brought to its heel. If, one day, SHE - THEY truly awake, what will this universe be?"
