 HLV_Hoshimachi_Suisei_desc:0 "Descending like a comet, a shining star in the rough! Idol and Vtuber, Hoshimachi Suisei! Sui-chan is... cute today too!\n\nFor years those words were one of hope, of inspiration, of reaching out to the world with kindness and compassion through the use of Vtubing. Now though? Now it is the motto of the leader of the Hololive occupation zone, the Guardian of Vladivostok, and Protector of the Far East.\n\nHoshimachi Suisei has come far from the small intendent Vtuber she once was. Becoming part of Hololive's Generation Zero she quickly became one of the world's most influential Vtubers, a trailblazer, much like the comet she is. Then Russia collapsed. The need to secure the Far East of Russia to remove a threat to Japan was seized upon by Hololive.\n\nSuisei won the first election with ease and now stands as President of the Hololive occupation zone, but there is still much to be done, Tokyo's orders are growing, corporate only has their eyes on the bottom line, and her fellow Idols all have their own ideas for how the Occupation Zone should be run. But Suisei is a comet, a burning brand in the night and she will not give up without a fight."

 NEN_Momosuzu_Nene_desc:0 "The Nenets People of northern Russia have long been under the rule of aliens, but never quite so as literally as under Momosuzu Nene, the current governor of the Nene Autonomous Region.\n\nHailing from the planet of TaoTao with the aim of meeting new people Momosuzu Nene first made her debut in the world through joining Hololive, debuting as part of their 5th generation. She quickly made a name for herself as an eccentric but loveable streamer proclaiming everyone who watched her streams to be her husbands, with her high energy levels constantly charming more, and more to her side.\n\nThen as Russia collapsed and Hololive moved into occupy the Far-East, due to a turn of fate, a desire for conquest, or perhaps simply misreading the map Momosuzu Nene and her force landed in of all places the Nenets Autonomous Okrug. An Okrug on the northern coast of Russia, only a few hundred kilometres from the mighty city of Arkhangelsk. Despite this misadventure she rapidly established control over the Okrug and proclaimed herself governor of the new Nene Autonomous Region adding yet another title to her list already challenging that of Settra the Imperishable.\n\nHer role is something hard to describe yet her allegiance to Vladivostok, and from there Tokyo is undeniable. Yet to the Nenets people she is just another ruler, a stranger one than usual but another one all the same. "
