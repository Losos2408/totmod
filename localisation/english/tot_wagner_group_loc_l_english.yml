 WAG_Yevgeny_Prigozhin: "Yevgeny Prigozhin"

 POLITICS_YEVGENY_PRIGOZHIN_DESC: "Strongest out of all military formations allied to the Russian Federation in the war in Ukraine was the ChVK "Vagner" - the Private Military Company "Wagner". Most effective of all commanders in the operation to "demilitarise" and "de-Nazify" Ukraine was the commander of ChVK "Vagner", one Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin. So it is, so it likely will remain; certainly the man that was once regarded as merely the cook of Putin is gone, replaced with a mercenary's mercenary.\n\nBut all that is irrelevant now. Faster than he could act, Russia collapsed, and now he is stuck in a town, Bakhmut, that he keeps calling "Artyomovsk" even though he himself has forgotten who or what an Artyom is and why a city would be named for Artyom. ("Was it some online cook's pet cat, or his cousin?" someone once heard Prigozhin ask.) With him is a host of Russian troops - not merely Vagnerovtsy, but also some of the most effective sections of the Russian regular forces.\n\nOthers might be preoccupied with Ukraine, but Prigozhin has better things on his mind. Why bother, especially when it'd almost surely be a lost fight? Besides, why settle for a discounted product when an entire Russia is ready for the taking? No, only Donbass needs to be taken, and after that Rostov, and thereafter the whole of Russia - and in that manner Yevgeny Prigozhin shall attain his rightful destiny: that of Tsar and Autocrat of all the Russias."
