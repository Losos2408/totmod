 OFA_Organisation_of_Fastiv_Agreements_desc: "In the midst of chaos and anarchy, Ukraine is a true anomaly. Affected as much as the rest of the country, it has managed to contain relative stability - and the §BOrganization of the Fastiv Agreements§! plays a key role in this.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Second Ruin, the factions pitted against each other realized that the continuing occupation of lands in the east and the interdependence that had emerged during the days of independence had not gone anywhere. Under such circumstances, it was impossible to wage war for reunification - so a conference was convened in Fastiv, resulting in an alliance between the various warlords to ensure peace, stability and mutual security against threats from outside.\n\nThe OFA acts as a kind of analog of the UN within a single country, turning it into a hyper-decentralized formation, a confederation - at the meetings of the Organization many decisions, problems and resolutions are submitted for consideration, which are accepted to be observed (which gives its effects), but each participant retains great autonomy in its actions, including in terms of the army, which gives rise to doubt about the true capabilities of the OFA to protect its participants.\n\nFor now, the Organization of the Fastiv Agreements is the only guarantor of peace and stability in a divided country. What will happen without it - so far no one tends to check, because everyone knows:\n\n§RThe OFA is the last frontier before a new, even more brutal and bloody war.
