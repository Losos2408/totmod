 UIA_Andriy_Biletskyy: "Andriy Biletskyy"
 POLITICS_ANDRIY_BILETSKYY_DESC: ""Do you want to live freely, or do you want to be enslaved?" From his heart, Andriy Evheniyovych Biletskyy yelled to the audience. Mother Ukraine is sick, because of the Ukrainians; Ukrainians are sick, because of the degenerates.\n\nThe Ukrainian nation has heroes, heroes like Symon Petliura, Evhen Konovalets and Stepan Bandera. But even heroes could not overcome a horde of diseases. Now, Ukrainian society and its people are infected by degenerates and traitors. Biletskyy knew that he must find the remedy. But where is the remedy?\n\nBiletskyy found the remedy in the ideals of Evhen Konovalets - Nationalism. Alas, was there even a time when those "democratic" and "liberal" charlatans did not worsen Mother Ukraine's condition? If Ukraine is to be saved, it is through the ideals of its predecessors. The cancer bearing the name "Russia" - which has been tormenting Ukraine since the fall of that red giant - not only infected Crimea in 2014, but also began to spread throughout Ukraine this year. But with that remedy, which is to be modernized, the cancer can be cured for good. Of course, those democrats are traitors who only pretend to be patriotic. Only Biletskyy can save Ukraine. He shall prove that everything those charlatans did in the past decades was wrong. He shall cure the Russian cancer in the country with his own remedy. Yes, he will be the Asclepius Ukraine in dire need!"
