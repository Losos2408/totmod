 POLITICS_ANDRIY_BILETSKYY_DESC: ""Do you want to live freely, or do you want to be enslaved?" From his heart, Andriy Evheniyovych Biletskyy yelled to the audience. Mother Ukraine is sick, because of the Ukrainians; Ukrainians are sick, because of the degenerates.\n\nThe Ukrainian nation has heroes, heroes like Symon Petliura, Evhen Konovalets and Stepan Bandera. But even heroes could not overcome a horde of diseases. Now, Ukrainian society and its people are infected by degenerates and traitors. Biletskyy knew that he must find the remedy. But where is the remedy?\n\nBiletskyy found the remedy in the ideals of Evhen Konovalets. After researching and reforming such a remedy, he realised that, the cancer bearing the name "Russia" - which has been enwinding Mother Ukraine since the collapse of that red giant - has begun to spread throughout the body of Ukraine after it infected Crimea in 2014. This year, 2022, he shall reproduce the remedy, clutch the necessary cures, and eradicate the Russian cancer for good. Yes, he will be the Asclepius Ukraine in dire need!"
