 POLITICS_AMIYA_DESC: "Many years later, as she faces the person before her, Amiya is to remember that distant afternoon when Haimao took him to Rhodes Island.\n\nFormerly an ordinary girl born in Australia, she lost her parents after an air accident. Drifting through the city of Sydney as an orphan, she met who she was destined to meet, Haimao. He brought her onto Rhodes Island, where Amiya spent her childhood merrily. After growing up, she became a secretary to Haimao. Young as she was, her personality and working style won everyone's hearts.\n\nAnd then, as time passed, the girl has now become mature. Already been through so much with Haimao and Kal'tsit, she has already decided that, well, she shall become him, become someone who brings people hope. Kal'tsit is a Caeser, a Caeser discarded by time. A country needs no Caeser, and its power shall belong to the people. But Kal'tsit does not understand that. Her mind has been clouded, blinded, thus Amiya shall make her see. The puppetmaster shall be asked to stay away from power, and after that, Amiya shall build up a family of harmony. She is ready to sacrifice anything for everyone, everything she loves."

They don't know that, after it was excavated, the woman regarded as the world's most skilled engineer oversaw all the construction on it. She is no one but Closure.\n\nBefore joining HyperGryph, Closure had already had a long career as an internationally well-known hacker. Theresa asked many people to invite her after HyperGryph was established. After Rhodes Island came into the world, she oversaw the reconstruction, expansion and structural adjustment of the vessel, all by herself. Additionally, she improved PRTS, an AI system already installed on the vessel.\n\nClosure likes to play pranks on others regularly. Being greedy for money, she is called "Our Sherlock" by Kal'tsit. But, she calls herself "Operator 42 Stars". Most of the time, she stays in the monitoring center, without taking care of any governmental affairs, but she isn't ignorant - she will intervene when she considers it "necessary".\n\nNow that Murmansk has been a success, Closure's position weighs even heavier. Shall the balance collapses, she will make her judgement.§!"

And on the other hand, her soft methods and efforts to improve the behavior of the troops also win her a bright reputation among those "rioters". But she knows where her loyalty shall belong to.

 ROI_Legitimacy_0_desc: "In this land of suffering, all beings struggle for destiny. In the vast and troubled land of Russia, various forces are intertwined. Perhaps HyperGryph had no connection to all of this, but everything changed after the "Decapitation Operation". Theresa passed away, and Haimao disappeared. HyperGryph collapsed. Amidst the storms, Kal'tsit, the head of the medical department, recommended Amiya to be the first executive of Rhodes Island Pharmaceutical Company, built by the remains of Eagle Union and the elders. Amiya succeeded, Rhodes Island succeeded - of course, Kal'tsit's plan was also steadily advancing.\n\nUnder the leadership of the company's top management, Rhodes Island thoroughly integrated into the government through personnel changes, transformation, and other means. Amiya declared the sovereignty of Murmansk Oblast and the legitimacy of its regime, but it was in vain. The local people were dissatisfied with the sudden arrival of the government. They protested, they marched, but without fuel, the spark could not start the fire. The government's army took action, and with the legacy technology and continuous development from the former company era, Murmansk surprisingly defended its territory. However, beneath the glittering surface, countless termites were eating away at the roots of the government's tree. They formed a giant network and were confident that one day, this giant tree would be eaten away by them, turning into rotten wood after it collapsed."
 ROI_Behind_The_Scene: "Behind the Scene"
 ROI_Behind_The_Scene_desc: "A new theatre was staged in Murmansk, where Kal'tsit, the director, producer, and screenwriter who stayed behind the scenes, commanded everything. The temporary Duma was completely at her mercy, and Amiya's influence in the government was constrained by an invisible shackle. "She still needs more guidance and education," so she said. Nonetheless, despite Kal'tsit's steering, there were still many problems in Murmansk, and her attitude towards the locals and her arbitrary decisions in the Duma made many dissatisfied. But for her, it was nothing more than noisy rumors.\n\nWhat's more important is that among these people was Amiya. Although she had been under Kal'tsit's guardianship since childhood, as she gained more experience and her thoughts matured, she increasingly took an opposing view to Kal'tsit's politics, believing that her methods and views were too extreme. This theatre was soon to reach its climax - the rebellious daughter and the strict mother - which lead actor will come out on top and win the best actor award in this ensemble drama?"
 ROI_Extraordinary_Security: "Extraordinary Security"
 ROI_Extraordinary_Security_desc: "The security guard in Murmansk is unique in the world. This policy was launched by the missing "Doctor" Haimao and Kal'tsit together, creating a mercenary force with advanced weapons and a policy of indifference and ridicule. They are actually loyal to Rhodes Island, but under Kal'tsit's authorization, they frequently go out to provide security services or volunteer armies for other warlords. Murmansk has made a fortune in wars with this unique advantage, and its abnormal economic development has brought about some relief.\n\nHowever, the crazy and transcendent thoughts of the leader of the Sarkaz mercenary, W, have caused concern for many people. Many high-level officials have pointed out that W poses a potential threat to the government, but all they got was Kal'tsit's words: "I have a thousand ways to tame the dog I let out. Its threat to Murmansk is not even as great as those of the rioters." Even so, Dobermann secretly formulated a plan to decapitate W to prevent this "greatest mercenary" from endangering everything she loves."
 ROI_Disappeared_Haimao: "Disappeared Haimao"
 ROI_Disappeared_Haimao_desc: "Oh, Decapitation Operation. You marked the beginning of all disasters. Theresa was killed, and Haimao disappeared inexplicably afterwards. That's the impression that most government officials have of "that incident," but Kal'tsit will never forget, PRTS will never forget, and Amiya will never forget.\n\nHaimao was the CEO of HyperGryph Technology, the "evil spirit of the Babel Tower," and the "doctor of Rhodes Island." As the genius and star of hope in people's minds, he carried too much on his shoulders, the lives of the operators, the commission of the Chinese government, and so on. In everyone's eyes, Haimao was the lynchpin of Rhodes Island. Without him, all the gears of this giant machine would come to a halt. Kal'tsit took temporary control, but in return, she faced a looming financial deficit and more civil rights issues. Amiya's appointment was seen as a compromise, but it was only a stopgap measure. How many "stone coffins" are there on Russian territory? This is what everyone wants to know. They must find Haimao, but except for Kal'tsit, the shadow on this old woman is too heavy and weighs down the bridge of Rhodes Island."

Pick up the handy tools around you and strike the enemy! History belongs to us, long live the people!\n\nUndoubtedly, Kal'tsit's brief rule brought excessive losses to the administration of Murmansk. Apart from the incredible fiscal deficit, what was even more astonishing was the locals' resistance to the "Rhodes Island" regime. Workers went on a comprehensive strike, and spontaneous militia and guerrilla organizations emerged in various districts like mushrooms after rain. The government had no choice but to send out W and her band of lunatics to suppress the rebellion. The problems on both sides were escalating day by day, and the involvement of foreign elements at Karelia forced Amiya to, with the order from Kal'tsit, sign a temporary agreement with the rebels behind the scenes. The agreement granted supreme power to the labor union and local ethnic autonomous organizations. Afterward, these organizations gradually merged into the Russian People's Autonomous Group, with a small portion of retired labor representatives remaining in the upper echelons aside from the radical youth and intellectuals led by Zima. Their goal was clear: wait for a perfect opportunity to strike down Kal'tsit, that old witch, drive out Rhodes Island, and ushering in people power!"

 ROI_start.1.t: "Tea Party"
 ROI_start.1.desc: ""It's a sunny afternoon. Lynx invites Cockroach and Dog to a cafe with fewer people." After being updated, PRTS created a new document called "Sufferings of the Lynx" and has been uploading it ever since. The newest chapter is titled "We Three". "Lynx gives her friends an important order. She says, 'We need someone to give ourselves the stick, and someone to give the carrot. Cockroach, you are the fire in the shadow that burns all the rotten things and conducts all the crime in the name of necessity. So, put up your mask of lunacy, and do anything you are able to.' Cockroach smiles, wiping a Sankta halo on her hand while taking a bite of an apple pie."\n\nThen, there's another paragraph, with the black text becoming white. "'And, my loyal Dog. Contrary to that ugly flying object, you shall never bark. Go show your mercy. Show the world your softness and kindness. But remember: the most hideous heart hasn't disappeared. It hides in the deepest part of the ravine of your heart.' Finishing her words, Lynx muzzles Dog, but keep the muzzle unlocked. She then proceeds to tear off the 'No Pet' sign on the door of the cafe."\n\nAnd abruptly, the story ends here. The "black-hair girl", staring at the screen, laughs. She gives herself a cup of coffee and continues to stare at the screen. When she is about to finish her coffee, the texts begin to twinkle, as green words appear below the final paragraph. "Lynx is not an honest one. She suffers, but she is not the Christ. Dog, seemingly kind, is in fact extremely dangerous, and not an honest one. Cockroach, seemingly hideous, has sympathy lying in her heart, but an ordinary one shall never see it.  And what happens next? Please refer to the next chapter." PRTS saves the document at here and pops up a "Microsoft Office has stopped working". The "black-hair girl" laughs and climbs onto the bed."
