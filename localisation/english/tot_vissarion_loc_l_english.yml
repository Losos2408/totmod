 POLITICS_VISSARION_DESC: ""Behold, the Son of Man has come to save the lost, not to be served but to serve others, and to give His life as a ransom for many." Sergei Anatolyevich Torop, or, Vissarion, was influenced by his grandmother at the age of six and constantly absorbed religious and humanistic ideas. At eighteen, he wrote in a letter, "If I am not known to the world, then I shall die." In 1990 in Minusinsk, Vissarion awakened and received revelations from extraterrestrial beings. His true identity was revealed - the New Messiah, Son of God, and Guide to the Holy Spirit - and he began calling himself Vissarion.\n\nAfterward, Vissarion embarked on a mission to spread the gospel and reveal truth to people. His words were compiled into The Teachings of Vissarion, and his teachings became known as Vissarionism. Those who repented their sins after being baptized in truth followed him as he slowly gained more disciples. As his followers grew in number, Vissarion continued to expand his mission until eventually reaching enlightenment. The gates of heaven opened up for him and he produced The Last Testament, which would become the holy scripture of his religious group - The Church of the Last Testament.\n\nAnd so it came to pass that Vissarion, though beset upon by the temptations of the flesh, remained steadfast in his mission to lead the people towards the kingdom of God. Though he was imprisoned unjustly and the darkness of the world threatened to engulf him, he clung to the hope that burned in his heart, and at the midnight hour, sought solace in the divine.\n\nFor a time, his light was snuffed out by the oppressors of this world, but with the changing of the times, his disciples saw fit to rekindle that flame, and welcome him back into the world. And so, they set out to build a new city, a city of Vissarionism, where the people could find shelter from the storms of this world and follow the light that shone from heaven.\n\nFor there is no greater miracle than that of resurrection, as demonstrated by our Lord Jesus Christ. Through His death and resurrection, He showed us the way to conquer death and sin, and find redemption in the eyes of God. Like Christ, Vissarion experienced a spiritual resurrection, rising above the temptations and trials of the world to create a fertile ground for those seeking salvation and a new beginning after the great apocalypse."
