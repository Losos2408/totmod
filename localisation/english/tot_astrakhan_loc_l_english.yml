 POLITICS_VELIMIR_KHLEBNIKOV_DESC: "In the ceaseless passage of time, it flows with an enigmatic cadence, cyclic and reversible. The sorcery of its history, once deemed insurmountable, shall be conquered. In distant years to come, death shall bathe momentarily in the ethereal surge of nothingness. Khlebnikov's deduction stands resolute, as time journeys through countless circles... returning from death's Stygian abyss to our mortal realm.\n\nRussia's collapse, yet again, aligns with his temporal doctrine, and the monstrous specter of war, relentless and bloodthirsty, befalls humanity with disaster. But Khlebnikov, he shall sever its head. He comprehends, he comprehends! The essence of time and numbers, it is Him! It is Him! The divine miracle known as Goyda, whom he shall heed, whom he shall fathom. The idealistic revolution, a cascade of resplendent golden threads, shall illuminate the Slavic earth.\n\nThe revolution of tangible futures, as Khlebnikov and Mayakovsky unite, has indeed returned, all returned! This revolution, a remarkable metamorphosis, a resolute spirit materialized into reality, emancipates humanity from exploitation and oppression, surpassing even the omnipotence of gods. The harmonious dawn of a new world commences, the epoch of injustice fades into oblivion, and the magnificent era crafted by humankind draws nigh!"
