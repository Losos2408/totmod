 DNR_Denis_Pushilin: "Denis Pushilin"

 POLITICS_DENIS_PUSHILIN_DESC: "At first glance, Denis Pushilin might look like the most ordinary official in Putin's Russia. He is the head of a separatist republic, a leader beloved by the people, and a puppet of the ruling circles. Such an opinion is, however, merely shallow.\n\nDenis Pushilin set out on his long journey in 1998 when he became a member of the National Guard of Ukraine. He was, however, not really interested in this job. Pushilin's life changed in 2011, when he met a real visionary, a genius of the 21st century - Sergey Mavrodi. A brilliant economist and a charismatic person, Mavrodi showed him the most important thing in life: Nothing is better than wealth. Banknotes, jewelry, or precious metals - nothing in the world is more pleasing than simply owning goods, and if someone thinks otherwise - let them shut up. One might not be able to bring his wealth to the afterlife, but why the hell does it matter, when he can live like a king?\n\nEventually, he began to support the so-called "Novorrossiyan" uprising, but it was still a part of his long-term plan - a plan that Denis Pushilin is eager to carry out. Let Kyiv burn. Let Kremlin's lackeys gnaw at each other to find out who could succeed that bunker-man.\n\nIn the end, Denis Pushilin always wins."
