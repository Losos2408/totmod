 POLITICS_OCTAVIANUS_AUGUSTUS_DESC:0 "Augustus was truly one of the best leaders of Rome, if not one of the best in history. He was able to significantly strengthen his state, make it a real empire. Now, in a new place and in a new time, his skills will be tested again.\n\nBeing the great-nephew and sole heir of Gaius Julius Caesar, his fate, in fact, was predetermined - he was to become the ruler of Rome. His entry into the struggle for this post happened quite early - at the age of 19 he was adopted by Caesar to make him his heir, and a year later, when he was killed, Octavian formed a triumvirate with Julius' other political heirs - Antony and Lepidus. After getting rid of the enemies of the triumvirate, and then from his former friends in numerous battles, Octavian became the sole master of Rome. During his reign, he was able to significantly expand the borders of the state, gave him stability, and consolidated power in his hands, becoming the emperor in everything except, perhaps, the name.\n\nOne day, while leading his troops into another battle, Octavian and his troops entered some... unusual forest. After that, it got colder, the weather changed, and when the princeps came out of the forest, the Romans found themselves in a new, completely unknown place. Without thinking twice, the outnumbered legions of Octavian seized power in Budzhak, into which they were transferred by the forest, and declared this land part of Rome.\n\nSince then, Augustus has ruled a piece of land in Ukraine. This does not come easily to him - the locals oppose the princeps, they do not understand his language, and the technologies of the barbarians turned out to be much better than those of the Romans. All these problems need to be addressed.\n\nThis is a path with no signs. Where will it take the Emperor to?"

 RIM_prudentia_imperatoris_desc:0 "Although our great emperor is from another era, he is a reasonable person. Perhaps he is not adapted to this time, its capabilities and technologies, but thanks to his wisdom, his patience and his prudence, we will be able to understand how these barbarians live, and maybe even learn the best from them."

 RIM_roma_invicta_desc:0 "We are the heirs of the great Rome. Heirs of a great civilization that dominated half of Europe. Civilizations, to whose capital all roads led, which influenced the culture of entire nations. Now, however, that legacy is under threat.\n\nAbandoned to the mercy of fate the devil knows where and at what time, we are in a very dangerous position. It is obvious that our science is far behind the technology of these barbarians, and that in a battle with their army of even smaller size, we have no chance of victory. That we are still alive is a miracle.\n\nThe locals don't like us either. Apparently, they do not want to meet us as liberators who will bring them enlightenment. It seems that for them we are "svoloti" and "klyatí zagarbniki", as these natives call us, and judging by the tone of how they pronounce it, these words do not mean anything good. So far, they have not really resisted us - from what we have already been able to find out, there has already been some kind of disaster, after which everyone is tired of the chaos - but it is a matter of time before they begin to raise the question of the expediency of our rule.\n\nOur legions are loyal to their emperor and commander, but will they be enough to save Rome and justify the phrase "Roma invicta"?"
 RIM_quae_dicunt:0 "Quae Dicunt?"
 RIM_quae_dicunt_desc:0 "Our main problem now, from which all the rest come, is the language barrier between us and these tribes. They, with very rare exceptions, do not know Latin, and we do not know their language, which they call "Ukrainian", or something like that. It wouldn't be worth our attention if their technology wasn't superior to ours. Obviously, if we want to restore the Roman Empire, we must learn something from them. The only question is, in what language - ours, or theirs? Should we stand our ground, or should we show goodwill towards the locals? And for that matter, what place will they have in our new Rome?\n\nThe future of the entire Empire may depend on our choice..."
