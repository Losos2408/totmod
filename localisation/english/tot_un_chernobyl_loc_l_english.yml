 CNB_charlatan_doctrine_desc: "The core of the defense of our mission here in Chornobyl-Prypyat is the Charlatan Doctrine, which calls for us to look scary enough to repel invaders. The Doctrine's effectiveness depends on the strength of three variables: research, equipment, and military strength. It is absolutely crucial, for the success of the doctrine and therefore the defense of the UN Mandate, that we do not fall behind our neighbouring polities. Otherwise, we are at risk of attacks or invasions from opportunists in our locality, which needless to say runs the risk of compromising our mission. Though we will not go to war for control over the lands that surround us, we must be prepared to defend ourselves - all this for the sake of humanity in these dark times."
