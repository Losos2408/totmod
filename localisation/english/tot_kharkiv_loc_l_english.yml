 POLITICS_IHOR_TEREKHOV_DESC: "Years ago, Ihor Oleksandrovych Terekhov was a right-hand man to Hennadiy Kernes, a predecssor of his. Then Kernes died, yet another victim of the pandemic, and Terekhov regarded it as his duty to keep Kernes' legacy alive. Then the war came, and Terekhov's duty radically changed - his duty changed from governance and development to mere survival. \n\nNow things have changed yet again. The central authority under Zelenskyy, bless his heart, has been severely weakened by the recent events, and now Kharkiv is on its own. Terekhov knows his duty, now: he needs to fulfill Kernes' ideas and go even further. The country shall become unified under Kharkiv's guidance; reunified, it will become an urbanistic paradise. All cities in Ukraine shall become modern and comfortable. Most importantly, Kharkiv shall shine most brightly of them all, and become the best city in the world."
