 HRS_Hirasawa_Susumu_desc: "The night falls. Another day rises. Hirasawa Susumu—or perhaps, now, that should be Susumu Shirovich Hirasawa — feels he cannot wake up from the dream he is sleepwalking through. Yet no matter how much he pinches himself, the world around him is changing.\n\nOn the 1st of October two absurdities took place. In the morning, he took a call from his dead friend, Fukuma Hajime. In the afternoon, two women named Hirasawa Yui and Hirasawa Ui appeared, claiming to be his daughters. Clearly, people who were not supposed to be had begun to appear in the world — but then why did everyone around him treat these abnormalities as if they had always been there?\n\nSeeking an escape from the madness of reality, Susumu travelled to the Far Eastern tundra with Haijme, Konishi Kenji and PEVO 1-go - although they were tricked to believe that they were going to find out why Hajime resurrected - so as to research into that GOYDA Susumu found in his mind. They established a research facility around a so-called Goyda Cultivation Stove as its core, and received funds from the Hololive Occupation in Vladivostok.\n\nDeep in his heart, the will to change the world has not died in the heart of the aging musician. He sees hope in this new power. If he treads carefully, the new P-Model may well become the ruler of Russia instead of a mere research facility. Then he might well be able to free the world from government, media, capitalism and lead humanity on to the way of BEACON - even if it burns his own life...\n\nO Climber! Spread your wings that were forgotten in exile's sorrow, and regain your power as if uninjured."

 HRS_start.1.t: "The Planet Observer"
 HRS_start.1.desc: "He exists and he observes, that has been the basic description of him, "Teacher" given by the Horse Bones since the dawn of time.\n\nThe most fascinating tales are told about his person, each one somehow more bizarre and extravagant than the last one. This has lead to those weak of faith to doubt his actions, but if there is one thing sure in this rotten world is that he, Hirasawa Susumu, from the days in which Blockbuster reined to the days in which GamerGate happened has always being the savior humanity needed, always managing to return the world to what it was.\n\nAnd yet now he feels weak at the knees thanks to the prospect of failure, all his adventures, all the skills he gained from them, all the fictions have become "true" thanks to the world descending into the Optical Reality, in the context of something that isn't Thujarit.\n\nBut adversity creates strong men, and Susumu can feel that now he has a chance to become a true savior. He always portrayed himself as see-through, but it is now thanks to the thing that he has unlocked his latent psychic power. Using his insight on his own head, he has discovered that the thing is called Goyda and that it is located somewhere in Russia.\n\nFeeling secure on his discovery, he marched to the frozen tundras, thinking of a plan to trick his friends into thinking that they were going to research why Fukuma resurrected from death. This was a cover for his real goal: to destroy that Thuja... that Goyda, no matter whatever it is.\n\nOr so he thinks, perhaps he will not destroy it. Instead, he will do the one thing that he has always aspired for:"

 HRS_start.2.t: "Memories of a Time Past"
 HRS_start.2.desc: "Kijin Seija drummed her fingers on the hotel balcony as she stared out across Vladivostok. The old suit she wore was tattered, but an air of elegance and defiance still remained. She had worn this from her days in Nagano, and she would keep it till she died. Her business may have been broken down; she may have been forced to the very streets, but her pride burnt bright.\n\nAnd now she was here. In a hotel in Vladivostok occupied by of all people Hololive. She snorted and leant into the banister. The last few months had been chaotic to say the least. A sudden rustle of paper in the wind brought her mind back to the task at hand as she stared back at the pamphlet she had gripped in the foyer.\n\nIt spoke of something insane, deranged, terrifying. To the north of the Hololive occupation zone a group of musicians were studying something. Something they claimed was behind the collapse of Russia. They called it Goyda, they also called it a good pay check. She looked around the room she was technically scamming her way into, and scoffed. Yes, she needed more money, and besides, she could always carve out power for herself, or even seek revenge to Yakumo-fucking-Yukari.\n\nShe turned and strode towards the phone dialling in the number listed at the bottom without a pause."
