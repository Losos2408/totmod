 HRS_Hirasawa_Susumu_desc: "The night falls. Another day rises. Hirasawa Susumu—or perhaps, now, that should be Susumu Shirovich Hirasawa — feels he cannot wake up from the dream he is sleepwalking through. Yet no matter how much he pinches himself, the world around him is changing.\n\nOn the 1st of October two absurdities took place. In the morning, he took a call from his dead friend, Fukuma Hajime. In the afternoon, two women named Hirasawa Yui and Hirasawa Ui appeared, claiming to be his daughters. Clearly, people who were not supposed to be had begun to appear in the world — but then why did everyone around him treat these abnormalities as if they had always been there?\n\nSeeking an escape from the madness of reality, Susumu travelled to the Far Eastern tundra with Haijme, Konishi Kenji and PEVO 1-go - although they were tricked to believe that they were going to find out why Hajime resurrected - so as to research into that GOYDA Susumu found in his mind. They established a research facility around a so-called Goyda Cultivation Stove as its core, and received funds from the Hololive Occupation in Vladivostok.\n\nDeep in his heart, the will to change the world has not died in the heart of the aging musician. He sees hope in this new power. If he treads carefully, the new P-Model may well become the ruler of Russia instead of a mere research facility. Then he might well be able to free the world from government, media, capitalism and lead humanity on to the way of BEACON - even if it burns his own life...\n\nO Climber! Spread your wings that were forgotten in exile's sorrow, and regain your power as if uninjured."

 HRS_start.2.desc: "Kijin Seija drummed her fingers on the hotel balcony as she stared out across Vladivostok. The old suit she wore was tattered, but an air of elegance and defiance still remained. She had worn this from her days in Nagano, and she would keep it till she died. Her business may have been broken down; she may have been forced to the very streets, but her pride burnt bright.\n\nAnd now she was here. In a hotel in Vladivostok occupied by of all people Hololive. She snorted and leant into the banister. The last few months had been chaotic to say the least. A sudden rustle of paper in the wind brought her mind back to the task at hand as she stared back at the pamphlet she had gripped in the foyer.\n\nIt spoke of something insane, deranged, terrifying. To the north of the Hololive occupation zone a group of musicians were studying something. Something they claimed was behind the collapse of Russia. They called it Goyda, they also called it a good pay check. She looked around the room she was technically scamming her way into, and scoffed. Yes, she needed more money, and besides, she could always carve out power for herself, or even seek revenge to Yakumo-fucking-Yukari.\n\nShe turned and strode towards the phone dialling in the number listed at the bottom without a pause."
