 HRS_Hirasawa_Susumu_desc: "The night falls. Another day rises. Hirasawa Susumu—or perhaps, now, that should be Susumu Shirovich Hirasawa—feels he cannot wake up from the dream he is sleepwalking through. Yet no matter how much he pinches himself, the world around him is changing.\n\nOn the 1st of October two absurdities took place. In the morning, he took a call from his dead friend, Fukuma Hajime. In the afternoon, two women named Hirasawa Yui and Hirasawa Ui appeared, claiming to be his daughters. Clearly, people who were not supposed to be had begun to appear in the world—but then why did everyone around him treat these abnormalities as if they had always been there?\n\nSeeking an escape from the madness of reality, and encouraged by Hajime, Susumu travelled to the Far Eastern tundra with Haijme, Konishi Kenji and PEVO 1-go. Upon hearing of the existence of GOYDA, they established a research facility around a so-called Goyda Cultivation Stove as its core, and received funds from the Hololive Occupation in Vladivostok.\n\nDeep in his heart, the will to change the world has not died in the heart of the aging musician. He sees hope in this new power. If he treads carefully, the new P-Model may well become the ruler of Russia instead of a mere research facility. Then he might well be able to free the world from government, media, capitalism—lead them on to the way of BEACON—even if it burns his own life...\n\nO Climber! Spread your wings, forgotten in exile's sorrow, and regain your power as if uninjured."
