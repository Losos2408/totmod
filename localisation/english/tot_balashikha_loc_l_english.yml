 BLS_Sergey_Sobyanin_desc:0 "Perhaps no one in the lands called 'Moskva' and 'pod-Moskowie' in Russian is as (in)famous as Mayor Sergey Semyonovich Sobyanin, de-jure ruler of the entire city of Moscow. It makes sense - for he was always prominent, ever since his predecessor Luzhkov - a clown with no good taste - appointed him to a post and later fell from power.\n\nIt is Sobyanin that has transformed Moscow into what is known to us today: a city with monstrous budgets comparable to entire regions or American states, with ostentatious entertainment and recreation venues built all over the place, but bedevilled by the largest anti-governmental rallies in the whole of the 2010s (harshly suppressed by his riot police, of course). Under his governance, a propaganda phrase was disseminated by opinion leaders and bloggers (read: clowns and buffoons in his pay): "How much more beautiful Moscow is under Sergey Semyonovich!"\n\nBy adroitly managing the money obtained for the increasing budget of Moscow from local and all-federal sources and keeping a good share for himself (from the budget earmarked for sidewalks), Sobyanin managed to win (buy) the confidence of the local officialdom and law enforcement leadership. They, too, repeat the slogan the buffoons do - or at least they did once.\n\nNow things have gone to hell, and Sobyanin will have to find out the level of return on investment he will receive on his bribes. Already his loyal supporters in the Duma seem not to be as loyal as they 'should be' - so then who knows what the others will think, now that Moscow has fallen into anarchy?"
