 BLS_Sergey_Sobyanin_desc:0 "Perhaps, there is no one as famous and infamous as Sergey Semyonovich Sobyanin himself in Moscow. Known as the mayor of Moscow, his emergence signaled the end of clownery and lack of good taste under his predecessor, Luzhkov.\n\nSobyanin turned Moscow into what we know now: a city with monstrous budgets (compared to other regions), new ostentatious places for entertainment or recreation, along with the largest rallies in the entire 2010s, harshly suppressed by riot police. Under his governance, a phrase "How prettier Sergey Semyonovich has made Moscow" came into use, while a lot of bloggers and opinion leaders (clowns) were employed by him. By managing the money obtained from the increasing budget of Moscow expertly and earning a good amount for himself from the budget of pedestrian tiles, he managed to win, or buy, confidence from the local officials and the representatives of law enforcement agencies.\n\nBut now, he has to find out whether his measures work in person, especially when his loyal supporters in Duma might not be wholeheartedly loyal."
