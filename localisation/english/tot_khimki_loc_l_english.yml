 KHM_Roman_Yuneman_desc:0 "What madness, what devilry has the whole of the Russian nation fallen to? What lunacy rules the world now, even in a place as relatively small as Moscow oblast?\n\nRoman Alexandrovich Yuneman yearns for the simplicity of the past. It was easier to be a sort of semi-loyal opposition, not as hardline as the likes of the FBK but still opposed to the Putinite government. It was easier when the only opposition he had to face was KPRF and YeR candidates, Smart Voting gone wrong, and harassment from the local and federal governments.\n\nYet now what must Yuneman face down? If it were Solovyov and Sobyanin alone, that would be tolerable. But now the lunatics at Skoltech have apparently made a computer possessed by Andrei fucking Kosygin. Then there's that maniac Okhlobystin that seems to have made a religion out of screaming and offering literal black magic offerings to one archaic five-letter word he repeats over and over again. And meanwhile Nightingale Shit and the Forever Mayor are still running Moscow into the ground!\n\nThe society of the future cannot be constructed until these maniacs of the past and present are destroyed. Muttering prayers and curses by turns under his breath, Yuneman does what he can to secure the welfare of Khimki's citizenry. There must be victory, and immediately—for without victory there is no survival."
