 POLITICS_SOLNTSESLAV_OGNENNYY_DESC: "The earth is sick, because of humanity. Through the sewer pipes, shit flows. Forests, once sublime and sacred, are being cut down one by one through the hands of greedy creatures who can see no further than their noses. Corpse-eaters bite into rotting carcasses every day to satisfy their hunger. The descendants of the once great Aryan race, now degenerated, are doing everything to destroy their home. In the end, they will surely perish in the cold void of space forever.\n\nBut Volkhv Solntseslav cannot let this happen. Having become a Volkhv at the end of the last century, he has decided to save his planet at all costs. In his opinion, only the spirit and blood that belong to the Aryans could truly save his planet. To save the world from destruction, the Aryans of Iran, India and Eastern Europe must unite.\n\nBut now Solntseslav is struggling in a difficult position. Nobody would recognise his statelet, and even amid Ukrainian chaos, he stands alone, like a black sheep. However, if he manages to capture Odesa and call India for help, those who are not indifferent might come to his aid. Then, across the lands of Little Russia, the sword of Aryans shall rise again."
