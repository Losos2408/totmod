 KRM_Dmitry_Medvedev: "Dmitry Medvedev"
 
 POLITICS_DMITRY_MEDVEDEV_DESC: ""On vam Dimon ... on vam Dimon ... on vam Dimon": this chorus of a myriad mocking dissidents and wags has followed Dmitry Anatoliyevich Medvedev ever since he was President of the Russian Federation all those years ago.\n\nHe switched with Putin and they kept mocking him. He fell out of power and they still called him Dimon. That bastard Navalny, who released three videos defaming him, went to jail and the mockery did not cease. He said every way he possibly could that he wanted to be left alone during the war, and still he was Dimon to them and nothing else.\n\nNow Medvedev can change that. Sitting in the relatively undamaged region of Crimea with the remnants of the government of the Russian Federation, he at last has a chance to put an end to the constant stream of mockery and assertions that he is nothing more than a joke. By regaining his control over Russia, and conquering Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and the rest of the post-Soviet sphere - as his old friend and boss Putin had once wanted to do - he will prove once and for all that the reality is as Medvedev's flack once said:\n\n"On vam ne Dimon!""
