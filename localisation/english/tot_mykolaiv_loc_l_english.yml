 POLITICS_VITALIY_KIM_DESC: "Everything's fate changed with that unexpected change. Ukraine, no exception; Mykolaiv, no exception: Vitaliy Kim, no exception either.\n\nAs the centrist Governor of Mykolaiv since 2020, Kim's image had always been a charming one. When Russian forces invaded, Kim was on the forefront of defense, making his name by keeping the Russians out of Mykolaiv. But then, everything collapsed.\n\nAt that moment, there was a voice calling to him in his mind. He knew that it was Korean, but he did not understand it. After struggling with it for a while, he eventually became adept in Korean, and the mist of that voice was cleared. He understood, he comprehended, and he believed.\n\nWhat was flowing in Kim's blood had finally waken. Abandoning his absurd centrist ideals, he seized the power in Mykolaiv by using his former image when everything fell down. Now, Kim vows to plant Juche ideals in everyone's heart. He is going to enlight himself, and the people, with the voice of the Supreme Leader in his mind. He will become him, and he will surpass him. The sun of a new Kim Il-Sung shall rise, and a new, strong Ukraine shall be under its light."
