 great_cold.1.desc: "CONFIDENTIAL\nFOR EYES OF HEAD OF STATE ONLY\n[GetDate]\n\nLatest observances, conducted by our meteorological services, have shown a surprising drop in temperature of air above Arctic, along with a sudden change in course of movement of Arctic winds - as of now, they are moving in a direction of our territory, along with lands of rival, unlawful governments, insurgents and warlords close to us. Thus, it is expected that previously expected average temperature of -2°C during daytime will drop to -20°C; nighttime average temperature will drop from expected -10°C to -30°C and even -35°C in some areas. The cold weather front is expected to come in the middle of December.\n\nThe situation is worsened by the fact that due to anarchy in our country, the links between power plants and majority of the cities have been disrupted or conquered by insurgents, which creates a frightening possibility of hundreds of thousands of our compatriots, if not millions, freezing to death in the following months.\n\nThus, it is highly advisable to start preparing the metropolitan and rural areas of our country to a much colder winter - probably, the coldest one these lands have seen in centuries."
