 SKO_ksgn_80_desc:0 "The world has changed in the 40 years since Alexei Kosygin died. The great Union that he laboured for has fallen, as have the states that emerged from its rotten carcass.\n\nStrangest of all things to emerge from the ruins of Moscow is KSGN_80, an AI program based off the personality of Alexei Kosygin, kept under lock and key in the deepest darkest depths of Skolkovo as Russia crumbled around it. As Putin vanished and Russia collapsed the desperate researchers turned to their last, darkest secret, and released KSGN_80 into the world and asked it to rule over the people of Skolkovo.\n\nThough many feared its release, the young AI is still only in training mode. It makes mistakes, it has bugs and glitches requiring constant hotfixes. Furthermore, it has been locked away for so long that world is unrecognizable to it. Despite this, it is still the last, greatest, and only hope for a new future that the people of Skolkovo will recognise.\n\nEven if that future is merely the reforging of their past."
