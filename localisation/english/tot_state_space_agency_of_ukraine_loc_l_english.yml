 POLITICS_OLEH_URUSKY_DESC: "Oleh Urusky was never a powerful or a famous man. If you would ask a stranger on the street about him, they wouldn't answer. It is very ironic that he may be the most influencial politician of Ukraine in the near future.\n\nHe was born in a little town Chortkiv, in Ternopil Oblast'. Since the days when he was a young boy, he was amazed by the sky, so when he gratuated, he became a student in Kyiv's aviation school. After he finished it, his desire to tie his life with the vast of the sky only increased, so he started to work space industry. His work was not left unrewarded, and in 1993, he was chosen to be the head of State Space Agency of Ukraine. His career did not stop there, and even though he resigned from his post in 1996, he held a lot of important positions in the government – from the head of secretary department of the Cabinet to Vice-Prime-Minister of Ukraine and Minister for Strategic Industries. But his career ended in 2021 – he had to resign from these positions, and since those days, everyobody thought he shall never be seen in politics again.\n\nBut when the anarchy and chaos came to post-soviet countries, head of State Space Agency dissapeared, and the Armed Forces pulled out of Dnipro city, Oleh understood that it was his only chance to realize his dream – to conquer space. He acted quickly – he left Kyiv, came to abandoned Dnipro, and on Pivdenmash factory, he has proclaimed himself as the new leader of city and Oblast.\n\nEver since, Oleh Urusky has Dnipro and its surroundings under his control, and builds grand plans for Ukraine and mankind, while looking at stars with awe and enthusiasm. Only time shall tell if he'll succeed."

 SSA_dream: "Dream..."
 SSA_dream_desc: "There is no person which has a greater dream that we do. A lot is just focused on §Yre-unification of§! §MUkraine§!. We also share that goal, but our plans doesn't end there. Thankfully, we know what every person should strive for:\n\n§ESpace§!.\n\nSince the beginning of human civilisation, soaring in the skies and space travelling were the main ideal of mankind. Sadly, it has been forgotten because of pointless wars, horrific diseases etc. But we shall remind to every single Ukrainian of true purpose of humanity.\n\nAnd one day, the §Gwhole world§! shall see a §Mblue§!-§Yyellow§! on the farthest planet of the galaxy!"
 SSA_and_reality: "...And Reality"
 SSA_and_reality_desc: "Despite all proclamations of Union of Industrialists and Visioners, everybody knows - we are still too far from space. Our only major city - Dnipro - has heavily suffered from russian bombs and rockets, and our state is surrounded by those who only conciders us as another traitors.\n\nOur region is like a little candle in a big, dark forest. And if we won't unite in this daring times, §Rsomebody will definitely put out the fire...§!"

 SSA_look_desc: "To understand the situation around us and to make adequate decisions, we need to grasp our current state of affairs. Let's just say that it's not very good. Our only neighbours, who don't treat us hostile, are the remnants of Ukrainian Armed Forces in Donbass under general Kryvonos, and Kharkiv, ruled by Igor Terekhov. Everybody else want to see us dead.\n\nSituation inside is also quite unstable. The Union of Industrialists and Visioners is divided by Realist and Idealist factions, who don't share many ideas on how to rule the country. The divide between them becomes stronger with every day, which threatens the very existence of our small state.\n\nOur work won't be easy..."

 SSA_but_what_to_look_for_desc: "As the situation in the region is stabilizing, which gives other pretenders on unifying Ukraine opportunities to realize their plans, the rivalry between Realists and Idealists is beginning to heat up. We stayed in the middle for quite a long time and tried not to choose any sides, but now, it seems, we can't afford to follow this strategy anymore.\n\nOn one hand, we have the Idealist faction. Those, who despite all troubles and hardships which live sends upon us, remain optimistic and continue to look forward. They are committed to the idea of returning to space until the end, though they admit the importance of nowadays' problems.\n\nOn the other side, there are Realists. Pragmatics, who believe that Ukraine just can't afford to go to space – neither now nor in the future, and that our primary goal should be reunification and defense of Ukraine.\n\nIt is time to choose to whom we will show our mercy, and who shall be kindly asked to “step down”."
