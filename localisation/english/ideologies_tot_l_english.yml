 avant_garde_patriotism_desc:0 "Original Avant-Garde was born between 19th and 20th centuries, and was a movement in art, advocating for abolition of old genres' limitations and borders, which, according to supporters of the idea, were only holding back expression of people. Avant-Garde had an atmosphere of futurism, desire to experiment, abolition of past times' ideas, restrictions and norms. This idea is furiously defying past, ancient and barbaric, as avant-gardists think, social traditions and rules, because if we get rid of those imaginary limits we drew for ourselves, the humanity may finally enter the new age.\n\nThose bold ideas got a lot of supporters and followers. One of their base is now located in a city called Dnipro, in Ukraine.\n\nEmbracing the soon-to-come era of future, but also considering the experience of past mistakes, avant-gardists in Dnipro came to a conclusion, that the cause of Ukraine's fall were two of the humanity's main vices - betrayal and degeneration. Old concepts and movements could not meet the challenges of today, they could not give Ukraine the future it deserved. It caused the appearance of traitors and renegades, who in the worst hours of the nation - 2014 and 2022 - stabbed its back. All of this lead to anarchy and chaos, which has covered the whole nation and country. Avant-Garde Patriots strive not to repeat that mistakes, calling for a real revolution in society - a revolution for liberation, for destruction of old principles and orders, for creation of a new nation on the empty base, the nation which is fully free of borders, which were stopping its progress and advance. The nation, which is united in this goal. The nation which shall not betray itself again.\n\nFor now, Avant-Garde Patriotism remains just a small, local movement, but who knows - maybe, those ideas will be the ones which shall replace the systems of past and current?"

 principatus_desc:0 "The Principatus is a system of government unique to Ancient Rome. Formed under the emperor Augustus, it is a monarchy with the formal preservation of the republic and its institutions. So, the Senate, Roman assemblies and Magistrates continued to exist, which were elected in elections, but they no longer had such influence as before, because their activities were controlled by the princeps, who was Augustus. Through this, he centralized power in his own hands, gaining more and more powers until they became equal to those of emperors in absolute monarchies. In parallel, Octavian continued to be only "the first among equals", whom the princeps was considered, for which his form of government was called the principatus.\n\nOf course, times are different now. With greater political literacy of the population, ordinary people are increasingly understanding that the principatus is a "legitimized" dictatorship, and dissatisfaction with this fact only continues to grow. Will Octavian's system overcome the test of time, or will it finally sink into oblivion? Fate will show."
