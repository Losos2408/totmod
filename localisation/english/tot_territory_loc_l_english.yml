 POLITICS_PETER_CLEMENT_DESC: "What makes people stick to their long journey of life? What brings people forth towards the future? Dreams. Goals. Although Peter Clement was born into a poor family at Territory One, he didn't waste his life. From a carpenter to a stagehand at Channel One, and then a popular host of a home improvement show, he acquired fame, but he never forgot his memories of childhood.\n\nUsing his image as a national figure, he found himself a new career in politics in order to improve his homeland and people. He founded Advance along with Julia Salisbury, and by upholding the banner of taxing the "historically rich" and using the money to promote large-scale progressive reforms, his party won the 1984 election with 81% of the votes.\n\nBut then, destiny had him tricked. The Capital, after suddenly losing connection with everywhere in his country, became unfamiliar to him. In the end, he found out an impossible truth - the Capital had moved to 38 years later and thousands of kilometers away, or, more specifically, Chernivtsi in 2022. Why? Why? Peter has now lost everything. He indulged himself in alcohol, but even that could not help him escape reality. Dreams? Never will be."
