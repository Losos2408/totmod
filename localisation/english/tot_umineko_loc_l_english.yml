 UNK.1.t: "The Most Unusual Meeting?"
 UNK.1.desc: "It was a rather cold evening, with freezing wind blowing all over the town. Usually, in this weather, everyone cancels their plans and stays at home - that, though, didn't apply to a lone, middle-aged woman, waiting for someone in an almost-empty cafe. She was seemingly getting nervous; probably, the person she wanted to see was late. But as an old-looking man entered the cafe, fear on the woman's face disappeared quickly. Thus, their meeting began.\n\n"Good evening. I am deeply sorry for being late," the old man said quickly yet calmly.\n\n"Don't worry, I am not a very punctual person as well," the woman smiled. "Instead of small talk, though, I wanted to ask you a question. Why, after decades of declining my invites, you have decided to contact me?"\n\n"Well, to be frank, there's something important I wanted to tell you. Remember that famous writer, Ryukishi07, who published 'Umineko When They Cry'?" the man asked, to which the woman nodded. "I know that you might not believe me, but I've been able to see visions after that release."\n\nThe woman, despite doubting him, stayed quiet, and the man continued: "Recently, I... I had another vision. I saw a woman - she feels so, so familiar, but no matter how hard I try, I can't recognize her. She invited me to a chess game, and said: 'Don't forget to call Gretel in'. I don't know why, but deep down, I feel that 'Gretel' is you. Right now, I will give you a USB disk with all my visions - my 'forgeries'. Please keep it."\n\nThe woman didn't know what to say. At this point, the story felt like it was straight from a movie, but she trusted him."
 UNK.1.a: "...fine. I will."

 UNK.2.t: "Without Traces"
 UNK.2.desc: "It was an ordinary day for Oe Kaede - a young nurse put in charge of taking care of a famous entrepreneur, an old lady in her nineties, Ushiromiya Eva. It's been a year since she started the job, and there's been no troubles with her patient: Eva has been very nice, polite and friendly. It was quite surprising for Kaede, because Ushiromiya Eva was the only survivor of the Rokkenjima Mass Murder in 1986 - Kaede thought that what happened there, along with being suspected and blamed as the culprit, scarred her for life, changed her for worse. Also considering her health deteriorating after having a serious disease in 1998, and COVID-19 confining her to a hospital ward, the nurse expected Eva to become grumpy, always-discontent woman; yet, seeing her happy personality, Kaede thought that maybe, wonders really can happen in this world.\n\nThese happy thoughts disappeared as soon as Kaede entered Eva's ward - her patient wasn't there. How could that be possible? How can someone older than 90 years old be able to unplug their life-support system and just... escape? No, that can't be. Kaede immediately ran to the hospital management - events like that can't go unreported, even if she risks losing her job. At first, managers thought of it as a prank, but after they've checked the CCTV footage, it became clear: Ushiromiya Eva is gone.\n\nPolice got information about a missing old lady from the hospital 10 minutes after the hospital management got a grasp of the situation. Immediately, the searches began; even the old files from the case about Rokkenjima events were analyzed again. Even some of the best minds of the Police Department were involved in the investigation - all to find one woman.\n\nThe attempts to find Ushiromiya Eva would continue for days, weeks."
 UNK.2.a: "Yet none proved to be succesful."
