 POLITICS_KUJO_JOTARO_DESC: "The Joestar Family is famous for its perseverance and patience. Small wonder, that, given that they've been around for literal thousands of years by this point. Kujo Jotaro is no exception to the broader trend.\n\nAfter the events in Egypt and the transfer of most of the arrows to the Foundation, Kujo trained as a marine biologist and began to set about his work as quietly as possible. But in early October '22, despite Jotaro's expressed wish to the contrary, he was torn away from watching dolphins in the seas and sent on a trip to Chernihiv and suss out whatever the hell happened in Sumy.\n\nTo that end, he set up a secret Speedwagon base in Nizhyn, or at least he would have, had Ukraine not collapsed at that exact moment. For survival, he had to seize power in the region - but that fell flat when the local firebrand Liashko led an ethno-nationalist revolt in Chernihiv.\n\nNow Kujo Jotaro is trapped here. His only thought: "Damn it! I miss my daughter.""
