 LYB_Ivan_Okhlobystin_desc:0 "Once upon a time, there was a man named Ivan Ivanovich Okhlobystin. He became an Orthodox priest, yet at the same time also an actor, a television director, and a television commentator. Some time before Patriarch Kirill suspended him a divinis (at his request), President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin gave him a watch for services to the Motherland. Ivan Ivanovich did not understand why he had received this gift. But he knew what he had to repay it with—loyalty.\n\nFrom that time on, whatever the President said, Ivan Ivanovich followed. Gone was Ivan Ivanovich's old monarchism, replaced only with a religious nationalist devotion to the President of the Russian Federation. Whatever he said, Okhlobystin parroted. And when the 'spetsoperatsiya' began, Ivan Ivanovich offered his best—he shouted to a crowd a cry of the ancient Oprichniki, the terrible words of GOYDA.\n\nThen... then things went to hell. The President suffered death. The Russian Motherland was split by traitors and slaves of a thousand enemy powers. And a power, the power corresponding to Ivan's favorite word, began to emanate all across Russia. The man now sitting in Lyubertsy knew he could only do one thing in response—and that is what the new leader of the Holy Goyda Order is doing.\n\nIt is a good thing for Okhlobystin that the rest of the world does not yet know what that is. If they knew, it would not end well. For whom, it cannot yet be said."
