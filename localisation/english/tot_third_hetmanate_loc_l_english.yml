 THM_Bohdan_Khodakovsky: "Bohdan Khodakovsky"

 POLITICS_BOHDAN_KHODAKOVSKY_DESC: "Ukrainians' weak spot was always their forgiveness, their mercy - at least, that's how Bohdan Khodakovsky, head of a far-right organization "Tradition and Order" and now the ruler of Zaporizhzhia, thinks. For far too long, Ukrainian people have played a game called "democracy", not realizing there was no winning. For far too long, Ukraine has been nothing but weak, torn apart from inside and outside by traitorous liberals, communists, progressives, and Muscovite scum. For far too long, Ukraine has been infected with parasites - there were so many of them, that they were treated as equals. And where did it lead the once proud nation?\n\nTo the abyss. Ukraine has once again entered its dark age, just as Ukraine's enemies wanted. Brother stands against brother, son against father. Khodakovsky has seen it before in history books many times: 1240, 1654, 1922, and so on. This time, however, will be different, for there is finally a man like him, who is bold enough to carry the banner of a struggle for a right, true idea, and shout that aloud.\n\nNo more shall Ukraine be weak. No more shall Ukraine be a laughing stock for Muscovite bastards. No more there shall be wars on Ukrainian soil between Ukrainian people. A new Ukrainian state shall be born through the flames of this war.\n\nAnd it shall stand\n§Rfor\nall\neternity.§!"
