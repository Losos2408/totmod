 POLITICS_VOLODYMYR_ZELENSKYY_DESC:0 "When Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy and Kvartal 95 wrote about Ukraine just suddenly falling apart into a hundred pieces in season 3, it was just a plot device. It wasn't meant to be some kind of prediction - yet here is Zelenskyy, and here is Ukraine.\n\nYears ago, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a comedian. He played the role of an everyman president, then became an everyman president. He did his best; things went alright at times, but other times there were difficulties - economic crises, corruption, political scandals - and then the supreme difficulty arrived. The Ukrainian lands were invaded by Russian fascists in the service of Putin. Putting the history of the past aside, he defended his people.\n\nNow a disruption has come. Communication with almost all regions has been lost, seemingly in a single moment. Whatever has happened, he hopes it isn't too bad - but he also fears that that hope may be more forlorn than he thinks."
