 BSB_Saeki_Ryuji_desc: "Whenever the bone-chilling Arctic winds cut across the equally icy face of Saeki Ryuji, he didn't hear their howling. Instead, this former clan retainer heard the gentle rustling of coconut palms and the symphony of seagull cries in the distance.\n\nDuring those times, he was one of the three trusted close aides under the command of Minamoto Chisei, bearing the code name \"Crow\". During the Dragon Awakened, mountains crumbled, and colossal waves surged,the fate of the entire nation of Japan, along with the Hybrid of the White Queen Izanami, hung in the balance. Yet, as a strategist stationed in the rear, he couldn't fulfill his duty by accompanying his lord to the grave, nor could he pull his comrades out. It wasn't until after the great war had passed and tranquility returned that he found himself alone. He only recalled his lord's dying wish: to retire after success, find a patch of sunny beach with them, and sell sunscreen.\n\nFollowing this ordeal, seven of eight Clan Chiefs had passed away, the Yamata no Orochi suffered severe losses, and the elite forces were completely gone. The momentum of the White Queen's bloodline had dwindled. Initially, Saeki Ryuji had contemplated disappearing from it all. But fate, in its cunning ways, placed the heavy burden of his former lord onto the shoulders of this humble retainer. He became the new head of the Execution Bureau of Cassell Jp., a puppet manipulated by the Secret Party to reshape the once-great underworld Clans.\n\nAfter the collapse of Russia, Saeki Ryuji's new "Clan Chiefs" desired the power of Goyda. They ordered him to lead a team to investigate the enigmatic Black Swan Bay in Siberia. Faced with this exile-like mission, Crow didn't say much. He obeyed, just as he had served his lord in the past. But he did more than just obey. Here lay his lord's past and the future of the Clans, and he intended to uncover it all."

 BSB_In_the_Lineage_of_Izanami: "In the Lineage of Izanami"
 BSB_In_the_Lineage_of_Izanami_desc: "The majority of personnel at Black Swan Bay Operating Base come from the Execution Bureau of Cassell Jp, or as the Japanese hybrids prefer to call it: Yamata no Orochi (The Eight Clans of Orochi). Clans’ lore recounts the defeat of the White Dragon Queen Izanami in her time, before she was executed by the Black Dragon Emperor Nidhogg, she hid her remains containing her power in the remote Japanese archipelago. Ancestors of the Clans stumbled upon this legacy by chance, and it’s this legacy that has allowed them to endure for a thousand years.\n\nIsolated from the world, the purity of the Japanese hybrids’ bloodline is unmatched by other scattered hybrids of the Nidhogg , such as the families of Secret Party. Furthermore, the vast Kotodama inherited by the White Queen’s lineage is unprecedented in the world. Thus, the strength of the entire base’s hybrids is not to be underestimated."

 BSB_The_Legacy_of_the_Buried_Dragon_tooltip: "We can get a glimpse of the secrets between the §gPower of Dragon§! and §PGoyda§!."
 BSB_The_Legacy_of_the_Buried_Dragon_desc: "Over a century ago, a group of farmers discovered the frozen remains of a Dragon here. For the following century and more, from Rasputin to the CPSU Central, all who knew this secret were captivated by its mysterious power. However, this power, before the secret facility in Black Swan Bay became operational, had not been fully utilized. At that time, Dr. Herzog had just been escorted to this frozen land, and he immediately began to unravel the secrets of the Dragon’s bloodline through various brutal experiments. It was during this period that hundreds of supernatural individuals were created, one after another, in Soviet-style wards.\n\nHowever, all of this was reduced to ashes in the explosion of 1991. The Dragon Embryos were stolen, the ruins were covered in ice and snow, and the dragon remains were buried once again. \n\nIt wasn’t until thirty years later, when the advance team of the Execution Bureau of Cassell Jp set foot on this frozen land, that they were astonished to find that the skeletal remains, deprived of the dragon embryos, were quietly reviving, responding to GOYDA’s call."

 BSB_Clans_Situation_0_desc: "Even as they leave their homeland, everyone in Black Swan Bay Operating Base is on edge. The Yamata no Orochi, the true force behind the the Execution Bureau Jp, the oncegreat Yakuza Clans, was already exhausted from their prolonged war against the Mou Kishu, and after the Crisis of Tokyo, it was nearly crushed. Not to mention how their Yakuza businesses were scattered those days. Seven of the eight Clan Chiefs have perished, leaving only the Chief of the Sakurai Clan with what little authority remains, maintaining the fractured clan ties. This lineage, which has endured for a thousand years, is like the Orochi, its heads and tails severed, and its decline is now evident."
 BSB_The_Snake_Keeper: "The Snake Keeper"
 BSB_The_Snake_Keeper_desc: "I saved the snake, but I'm not the farmer." - Hilbert Ron Anjou\n\nSince the Black Ship entered Edo Bay, the Secret Party has been searching for hybrids on this isolated archipelago, but it wasn't until the end of the 19th century that they discovered the existence of hybrids on the archipelago. It wasn't until the first contact that they were surprised to find that organized hybrids activity had been going on within the islands for thousands of years. At that time, these impoverished samurai were struggling in the midst of a fierce social revolution, but even in their decline, the Secret Party was well aware that the power of hybrids was never to be underestimated, so they began to cooperate with these former noble Clans. \n\nSure enough, the Yamata no Orochi quickly rose again in the underworld of Yakuza with the powes of hybrids and sneered at the Secret Party Colonizers. Both sides even went head to head on battlefields of the Pacific War. After World War II, the Clans suffered a great blow, and the Secret Party took the opportunity to strengthen its control. The Cassell College , run by the Secret Party , began to admit a large number of outstanding Japanese hybrids and established the Cassell College Japan Branch based on them. \n\nDespite some grievances, a paper alliance has lasted to this day. In the Crisis of Tokyo, if it weren't for Anjou ,the Principal of Cassell College ,acting in time, the Clans’ existence might have been completely wiped out. It was this act of saving grace that gave the Secret Party the opportunity to truly control this once uncontrollable hybrid power. After restructuring the Japan branch, the Secret Party has become the new lord of these samurai. Despite their dissatisfaction, today's Japan branch has long become a snake in a jar, dancing to the tune of the snake keeper."
